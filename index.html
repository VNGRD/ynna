            <td>the first website i ever made! originally also meant to be a new tab page for links, with each quote acting as a hint to what the link would lead to. not the most readable thing in the world, but it holds a special place in my heart. eventually superseded by <a href="https://vngrd.github.io" target="_blank">vngrd.github.io</a>.</td>

    <h2>other things</h2>
    <p><b>why the .xyz domain?</b></p>
    <p>just because i thought it was cool. and because other domains are a tad more expensive.</p>
    <p><b>what does "ynna" mean?</b></p>
    <p>secret ;)</p>
    <p><b>where else can i find you online?</b></p>
    <p>not much elsewhere, but perhaps you may be interested in checking out my <a href="https://github.com/VNGRD" target="_blank">github</a>? :D</p>
