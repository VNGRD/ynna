            <td><a href="https://mdhvn.xyz" target="_blank">mdhvn.xyz</a></td>
            <td>An HTML+CSS-only personal website, focused on simplicity. Nothing too flashy. Made from scratch and with lots of ♡. This is what got me into Cloudflare!</td>

            <td><a href="https://rzy.neocities.org" target="_blank">rzy.neocities.org</a></td>
            <td>The first website i ever made! Originally, this was also meant to be a new tab page for links, with each quote acting as a hint to what the link would lead to. Not the most readable thing in the world, but it holds a special place in my heart. Eventually superseded by <a href="https://vngrd.github.io" target="_blank">vngrd.github.io</a>.</td>

    <p>As in, stuff I did not create on my own, but played around with to suit my own needs.</p>

            <td><a href="https://vngrd.github.io" target="_blank">vngrd.github.io</a></td>

Mostly played with changing color schemes in the code according to the color theme of my PC. This was what led me to look into GitHub in order to host a page on the web without having to purchase a domain -- as such, this homepage is hosted using GitHub Pages!</td>

I came across this whilst looking for a way to keep bookmarks that wasn't reliant on a bookmarks toolbar on a web browser.

            <td>I firmly believe that the heart of the internet is the people using it; not a website, not a company, not anything <em>but</em> the people. This page asks its visitors: <em>"What do you want from the internet?"</em> and allows one to respond in the form of a letter. This is probably one of the most human webpages I've seen in a long time.</td>

    <h2>Other things</h2>
    <p><b>Why the .xyz domain?</b></p>
    <p>Just because I thought it was cool, and because other domains are a tad more expensive.</p>
    <p><b>What does "ynna" mean?</b></p>
    <p>Secret ;)</p>
    <p><b>Where else can I find you online?</b></p>
    <p>You can find me at <a href="https://cyberspace.online/mdhvn" target="_blank">cyberspace</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VNGRD" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!:D</p>
